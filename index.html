     <p>
     This document provides non-normative guidance on Web of Things (WoT) security and privacy.
     The Web of Things is descriptive, not prescriptive,
     and so is generally designed to support the security models and mechanisms of the systems it describes,
     not introduce new ones.
     However, a WoT System also has its own unique assets, such as a Scripting API and Thing Descriptions, that
     need to be protected and also have security and privacy implications.
     </p><p>
     We define the general security requirements for a Web of Things (WoT) System using a threat model.
     The WoT threat model defines the main security stakeholders, security-relevant assets,
     possible attackers, attack surfaces,
     and finally threats for a WoT System.
     Using this generic WoT threat model for guidance,
     it should be possible to select a specific set of security objectives for a concrete WoT System implementation.
     We provide several examples using common scenarios based on home, enterprise, and industrial use cases.
     We also provide more general suggestions for the design and deployment of a secure WoT System.
     All recommendations are linked to the corresponding WoT threats in the generic woT threat model in order to
     facilitate understanding of why they are needed.
     </p><p>
     It is not the intention of this document to limit the set of security mechanisms that can be used to 
     secure a WoT System.
     In particular, while we provide examples and recommendations based on the best available practices in the industry,
     this document contains informative statements only.
     Specific normative security aspects of the WoT specification are defined in the corresponding normative WoT documents
     for each WoT building block.

      <h1>Lifecycle of a WoT Device</h1>

                width="100%"
                title="WoT Device Lifecycle"/>
           <figcaption>WoT Device Lifecycle</figcaption>
       </figure>

      <p>The lifecycle of a WoT Device is similar to the lifecycles of other IoT devices and services.
      It may in fact be identical if a WoT Thing Description is being used simply to describe an existing device
      implemented using another standard.
      However, 
      for discussion purposes we will use the generic lifecycle shown in <a href="#wot-lifecycle"></a> 
      which includes the following states:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manufactured:</strong> The WoT Device has been manufactured by an OEM.
		It might have a WoT runtime present that enables single or multi-tenant users 
                or it might only have network interfaces exposed present that are compatible with a WoT description.
		From the Manufactured state, based on the deployment scenario, the device can transition to either of two states: 
		the Installation/Commissioning state or the Security Provisioning state.</li>
        <li><strong>Installation/Commissioning:</strong> A WoT Device has been installed into its intended deployment environment
		by a system provider or system integrator and any necessary SW configuration has been performed. 
		In practice this state may be combined with or reordered with the Security Provisioning state.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Provisioning:</strong> A WoT Device is provisioned with the security metadata and credentials needed 
		during its Operational state. 
		The exact set of necessary credentials will vary based on the WoT Device's deployment model and choice of security mechanisms. 
		The document <cite>The State-of-the-Art and Challenges for the Internet of Things Security</cite> [[Garcia17]] 
		refers to this stage as "Bootstrapping".</li>
        <li><strong>Operational:</strong> The default operational state of WoT Devices. 
		Devices in this state are fully ready to communicate over WoT interfaces and satisfy their deployment's operational roles. 
		From the Operational state a device can return to the Manufactured state 
                if it is fully decommissioned and security de-provisioned 
		(link E in <a href="#wot-lifecycle"></a>). 
		It is also possible to perform only a partial reset of a device,
		if it only requires re-installation and recommissioning without security re-provisioning 
		(link D in <a href="#wot-lifecycle"></a>).
		It is also possible that only security re-provisioning is needed 
                without re-installation and re-commissioning (link C in <a href="#wot-lifecycle"></a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance and Security Update:</strong> 
                A state that is entered when the device's software or configuration needs to be updated.
	        This is an optional state that can be activated remotely or locally (link A in <a href="#wot-lifecycle"></a>) 
		on a WoT Device depending on the deployment model and overall setup. 
		This state can be required to maintain security,
                for example to patch SW vulnerabilities or perform security-related configuration updates, 
		such as key revocation or certificate refresh. 
		After maintenance or updates are done, 
		the device normally returns to the Operational state (link B in <a href="#wot-lifecycle"></a>). </li>
      </ul>
      The scope of this document only covers the Operational State of a WoT Device 
      with the assumption that all relevant security metadata and credentials has been 
      successfully provisioned during the Security Provisioning state and 
      are available transparently to the WoT runtime level. 
      Security-related system management updates (such as the revocation and update of keys and other credentials),
      while important to maintaining the security of a system, are considered to be out of the scope of this document.

    <h1>Requirements</h1>
	
        <section>
        <h2>General</h2>
            <p>
            In general using the WoT approach should "do no harm": the security of any protocols should be maintained.
            The Web of Things does not introduce new security mechanisms, 
            but should preserve the functionality and security of existing mechanisms.
            We also have the following requirements:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exposing:</strong>
                When exposing a TD, especially via the Scripting API,
                it should be possible to use best practices for security,
                including maintaining the integrity of the TD and delivering it only to authorized recipients.</li>
                <li><strong>Consuming:</strong>
		A consumed TD should accurately reflect the actual security status of the device it describes.</li>
                <li><strong>Protocols:</strong>
                The WoT can potentially apply to many protocols but to limit scope in this 
                discussion we will focus on the needs of HTTP(S), CoAP(S), and MQTT(S).</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="wot-threat-model">
        <h2>Threat Model</h2>
            <p> 
              Due to the large diversity of devices, use cases, 
	      deployment scenarios and requirements for WoT Things,
              it is impossible to define a single WoT threat model that would fit every case.
              Instead we describe here an overall WoT threat model framework that can be adjusted
              by OEMs or other WoT System users or providers based on their concrete security requirements.
	      This framework gives a set of possible threats that implementers should
	      consider, but which may or may not apply to their WoT System.
            </p>
            <p>
            When selecting suitable mitigations to the WoT threats described, it is important to consider various
            criteria that might increase the risk level for a particular WoT architecture, such as handing
            privacy-sensitive data, physical safety of individuals or the surrounding environment, high
            availability requirements, and so forth.
            In addition threat mitigations will always be limited by the capabilities of underlying 
            devices, their list of supported security protocols, processes isolation capabilities, etc. 
            </p>

      Don't want the devices they make to be used in any form of attack

      An <a>OEM</a> might simultaneously be a System Provider,
      although System Providers might also
      define new TDs or modify TDs provided by other entities (<a>OEM</a>s).
      System Providers
      might use the WoT scripting API and runtime to implement their solution
      or might do a full reflash of the device to install their own software stack.
      A System Provider's scripts and their configuration data might require
      confidentiality and/or integrity.
      A System Integrator/Installer is similar to a System Provider but tends to
      reuse rather than create new technology.

      Don't want security to interfere with usability for better sales
      (usability vs. security).

      the WoT System to obtain some functionality.

              trust model as well as execution context boundaries.

 <h2>Security Scenarios</h2>
  <p>
    Here we describe some typical high-level WoT scenarios and give practical examples of the above threats
    for each scenario.   
  </p>

<section>
<h3>Scenario 1 - Home Environment</h3>

<p>In this scenario we assume a standard home environment with a WoT System running behind a firewall NAT that
 separates it from the rest of the Internet. However the WoT System is shared with the standard user home
 network that contains other non-WoT Devices that have high chances of being compromised. 
 This results in viewing these non-WoT Devices as possible network attackers 
 with access to the WoT System and its APIs/Protocol Bindings.
 Other assumptions: 
 WoT scripts and protocol bindings are considered trusted; a single <a>System Provider</a> exists on physical
 WoT Devices; and no dynamic installation of WoT scripts is possible.</p>

<p>In this scenario the following <strong>WoT Threats</strong> are possible:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th><strong>Threat name</strong></th>
<th><strong>Example(s)</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a>WoT Protocol Binding Threat</a></td>
<td>A compromised application on a user smartphone connected to the same internal network as WoT Devices sends
a malformed request to a WoT Device targeting the Protocol Bindings interface directly. 
This malformed request causes
the respective Protocol Binding to be compromised (e.g. by exploiting a buffer-overflow bug)
and the attacker is able to run code with the privileges of
the Protocol Binding on the WoT Device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a>WoT Interface Threat - Exposed Thing Compromise</a></td>
<td>A compromised application on a user smartphone connected to the same internal network as WoT Devices sends
 a malformed request to a WoT Device using the WoT interface. This malformed request causes the respective 
 Exposed Thing to be compromised and attacker is able to run code with the privileges of the Exposed Thing on
 the WoT Device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a>WoT Interface Threat - Unauthorized WoT Interface Access</a></td>
<td>A user's party guest with network access to the same internal network as WoT Devices uses his device
 to send a WoT interface request to a user's WoT Device for a certain resource access, for example, to get a 
 video stream from user's video camera footage or permission to unlock some rooms in the house. Due to lack of
 proper authentication, he is able to access this information or execute the required action (e.g. opening the 
 targeted door).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a>WoT Communication Threat - TD Authenticity</a></td>
<td>A compromised application on a user smartphone connected to the same internal network as WoT Devices
  listens to the network and intercepts a legitimate TD sent by one of the WoT Devices. Then it modifies the TD
  to state different authentication method or authority and forwards it to the intended device. The device
  follow the instructions in the modified TD and sends authentication request to the attacker's specified 
  location potentially revealing its credentials, such as username and password. Similarly instead of modifying the 
  legitimate TD, an attack might save it and use iit later on, for example when it would be updated to a newer 
  version. Then, an attacker substitutes a new version of the TD with an older version to cause DoS to a device
  trying to get an access to a resource. An additional reason for using an older TD might be exposing a 
  previously available vulnerable interface that got hidden when the TD was updated to a newer version. This can 
  be a stepping stone to conducting other attacks on the WoT System.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a>WoT Communication Threat - TD Confidentiality and Privacy</a></td>
<td>A user's party guest with network access to the same internal network as WoT Devices using his device
 listens to the network and intercepts a legitimate TD send by one of the WoT Devices. While inspecting the TD
 he/she learns privacy-sensitive information about the host, such as presence of medical tracking or
 assistant equipment, name of healthcare provider company etc.
 An example of privacy threat: a compromised application on a user smartphone connected to the same internal
 network as WoT Devices listens for publicly broadcast TDs and sends this data to a remote attacker to build
 a profile of devices installed in the home and their purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a>WoT Communication Threat - System User Data Authenticity</a></td>
<td>A user's party guest with network access to the same internal network as WoT Devices using his device
 listens to the network and intercepts a legitimate WoT interface request to set some settings on some
 actuator, for example the time when house doors get locked and unlocked. He then modifies the specified value
 to the desirable one and then forwards the request to the destination WoT Device. The destination WoT Device
 accepts incorrect settings.<br />Another attack example is a replay of a legitimate WoT interface request to
 set a setting, for example, increase temperature of the house by a number of degrees. When repeated many
 times, it might not only make living environment unusable, but also might damage the heating equipment.<br />Another
 attack involves replaying an old legitimate WoT interface request that attacker intercepts while visiting the
 user's home, such as commands to unlock doors, stop camera recordings etc. from a different time when the user
 wants to get authorized access to the house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a>WoT Communication Threat - System User Data Confidentiality and Privacy</a></td>
<td>A user's party guest with network access to the same internal network as WoT Devices using his device
listens to the network and intercepts WoT interface exchange between legitimate entities. From that exchange 
the guest learns privacy-sensitive information about the host, such as a data stream from his medical 
tracking equipment, information about user's preferences in home environment, video/audio camera stream etc.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a>WoT DoS Threat</a></td>
<td>A compromised application on a user smartphone connected to the same internal network as WoT Devices sends
  huge amount of requests to either a single WoT Device or all device available in the WoT System using 
  directly Protocol Bindings interface or WoT interface. These requests take all the processing bandwidth of a
  WoT Device or WoT System and make it impossible for legitimate users to communicate with WoT Devices or 
  devices to communicate with each other. Depending on the implementation it can also lead to the case that 
  alarm or authentication systems might be disabled and thieves get into user's house (however systems should
  always implement "safe defaults" principle and in such cases keeps doors closed despite of inability to 
  authenticate).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a>WoT Communication Threat - Side Channels</a></td>
<td>A compromised application on a user smartphone connected to the same internal network as WoT Devices
 listens to the WoT System traffic. 
 By this passive listening, he is able to infer various forms of privacy-related
 information, such as WoT System configuration, WoT Devices that are present, 
 network active and passive phase timing,
 etc.

  <h3>Scenario 2 - Business/Corporate Environment</h3>

    <p>In this scenario we assume an office building environment shared between a number
     of independent companies (tenants) with a shared WoT System running that controls temperature, lights, video
     surveillance, air etc. 
     The companies sharing the premises do not trust each other and can be viewed as potential attackers.
     However, we assume that there is a trusted non-compromised <a>System Provider</a>
     that sets the WoT System through the whole building and handles the on-boarding and termination process
     for all building tenants (making sure that after company leaves the building, all its data is not present
     in the WoT System anymore).
     Compared to Scenario 1 above, the main challenge here is to securely share the WoT System
     between these companies and make sure their WoT <a>System User Data</a> (that can include
     highly confidential company information) is not exposed, tampered with, etc. 
     Additionally one has to take into account the fact that a set of building tenants might change from
     time to time, including employee turnover in each company. Therefore the WoT setup
     must be flexible enough to start and terminate access to the WoT System promptly to both
     companies (entire sets of users) and individuals.
     Privacy is also important here, because companies need to make sure that the data about their
     employees or clients is well protected, including such information as employee presence. 
     Since we assume the presence of a trusted <a>System Provider</a>, we can consider the WoT scripts and
     protocol bindings to be trusted also. 
     Similar to Scenario 1, there is only a single <a>System Provider</a> present on
     physical WoT Devices, and no dynamic installation of WoT scripts are possible for simplicity.
    </p>


<p>In this scenario the following <strong>WoT Threats</strong> are possible:</p>

    <table>
    <tr>
    <th><strong>Threat name</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Example(s)</strong></th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td><a>WoT Protocol Binding Threat</a></td>
    <td>This attack is similar to the one described in Scenario 1 where a WoT System shares 
     connectivity with other non-WoT Devices (smartphones, PCs, etc.). 
     In this case a company's employee can send a malformed request to a WoT Device targeting a
     Protocol Binding interface directly. 
     This malformed request causes the respective Protocol Binding to be compromised and attacker
     is able to run the code with the privileges of the Protocol Binding on the WoT Device. 
     As a result the attacker can get any WoT asset from that device, including <a>System User Data</a> 
     from another company. 
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><a>WoT Interface Threat - Exposed Thing Compromise</a></td>
    <td>Similar to Scenario 1, but the attack can be done by an employee with network access to the
    same internal network as WoT Devices.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><a>WoT Interface Threat - Unauthorized WoT Interface Access</a></td>
    <td>An employee with network access to the same internal network as WoT Devices using his device
    sends a WoT interface request to obtain the data from a WoT video camera device located in a meeting
    room of another company or to unlock the door to another company's office wing. Due to lack of proper
    authentication, he is able to access this information or execute the targeted action 
    (e.g. opening the door and getting physical access to another company's premises).
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><a>WoT Communication Threat - TD Authenticity</a></td>
    <td>Similar to Scenario 1, but the attack can be done by an employee with network access to the
     same internal network as WoT Devices.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><a>WoT Communication Threat - TD Confidentiality and Privacy</a></td>
    <td>If we assume that all Things and their TDs are standard to
    the building, then unlike Scenario 1 we can (perhaps) assume that all info in them is public 
    (since they relate to System provider and not system users).  However, if companies or employees
    can add their own devices to the WoT System (for instance, wearables or desk lamps) than
    the system may have to protect non-public TDs.
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><a>WoT Communication Threat - System User Data Authenticity</a></td>
    <td>
    Similar to Scenario 1, but the attack can be done by an employee with network access to the same
    internal network as WoT Devices. In case this if the attack succeeds, an attacker may be able to control other's
    company WoT Devices using actuator capabilities (including unlocking doors), changing important settings
    (such as heating controls, disrupting a company's business activities) etc.

      and employees (including, for example, employee presence information).

    <td><a>WoT DoS Threat</a></td>
    <td>
      An employee with network access to the same internal network as WoT Devices using his device
      sends a huge number of requests to either a single WoT Device or all devices available in the WoT System
      using either the Protocol Bindings interface directly or the WoT interface. 
      These requests consume all the processing or bandwidth of a WoT Device or WoT System and make it impossible
      for employees of other company to communicate with WoT Devices or devices to communicate with each 
      other. Depending on the implementation it might also lead to alarm or authentication systems
      being disabled and allowing attackers to get into other company's premises (however systems should always
      implement "safe defaults" principle and in such cases keeps doors closed despite of inability to 
      authenticate; but this causes the opposite problem of denying authorized users access and disrupting
      legitimate business).

   <h3>Scenario 3 - Industrial/Critical Infrastructure Environment</h3>

   <p>In this scenario we assume an industrial factory or infrastructure (power plant, water distribution
     system, etc.) environment that is using WoT System 
     to monitor or perform certain automation tasks in its Operational Technology (OT) network.
     Compared to other scenarios above, the main challenge here is to guarantee safety and availability
     of the critical infrastructure. 
     Therefore, for example, Denial-Of-Service attacks must be mitigated as well as possible. 
     On the other hand, privacy is usually less important for this scenario. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Similar to the previous scenarios, we assume that there is a trusted non-compromised <a>System Provider</a>
     that sets up the WoT System, so we can consider all WoT scripts and protocol bindings to be
     trusted also. 
     We also assume there is only a single <a>System Provider</a> present on physical WoT Devices and
     a single tenant on all system, and assume no
     dynamic installation of WoT scripts is possible for simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Due to the high safety and availability requirements in the industrial environment, 
     typically the WoT System (part of a bigger OT network) won't be shared with other tenants of the same
     building and normally won't be shared with the general IT network of the same company.
     The IT network is where all other company operations are happening, for example, accounting. 
     We also don't expect factory employees to browse the internet in the coffee break using the OT network
     (and ideally not the IT network; in some companies, a third network is even provided for employee personal use 
     or for less-trusted personal devices.) 
     However, usually some bridging must be present between the OT
     and IT networking in order to support monitoring requirements, so these networks are not fully isolated. 
     In this scenario, 
     the risk of compromised devices and applications interacting with the WoT System is limited 
     but nonetheless present.
     Therefore the usual WoT threats, described in the previous scenarios, still apply, if a malicious
     application or device gets into the industrial OT WoT System. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, a factory employee with authorized access to
     the OT WoT System can be also viewed as a potential attacker. 
     The additional security challenge in this case is role management, i.e. distribution of authorized
     accesses between the actors (factory employees, devices with actuators, etc.) in such a way that a single
     misbehaving actor does not have enough authorization to endanger the safety and availability of the whole
     infrastructure. 
     Similar to the case in Scenario 2, the ability to promptly terminate an employees’ access rights to the 
     WoT System when necessary, and without disrupting other activities, is essential.

      <h1>Privacy Considerations</h1>
            <p>              
              In this section we focus specifically on the privacy aspects that are important to keep in mind

	      The threat model, described in <a href="#wot-threat-model"></a>,
              already takes into account numerous privacy-related threats and aspects.
	      However, this section summarizes them and gives guidelines
              and recommendations specifically aimed at minimizing privacy-related risks.

                 <td> Thing Descriptions (TDs) might leak privacy-sensitive information, such as
                      detailed configuration of a single WoT Thing.</td>
                 <td>WoT TDs should minimize the amount
                      of information that is publicly available about a WoT Thing.
                      There has to be a way (if a TD is privacy-sensitive) to limit clients who can
                      obtain a certain TD (or its privacy-sensitive parts) via authentication and
                      authorization methods. 
		      It is also possible to expose a number of TD variants
                      for the same WoT Thing based on the level of client's access.  
                      This recommendation corresponds to the data minimization

		      WoT System by observing the TDs
                      that the target WoT System downloads from a Thing Directory. 
                      In addition, loading JSON-LD context files might also leak WoT System configuration.
		      For example, context files may be used to allow TDs to be extended with
		      new protocols and security schemes; loading these context files then
		      implies the TDs uses these protocols or schemes. </td>

                      lifecycle (immutable) or changed very rarely (for example only when a WoT System is
                      installed and bootstrapped), then a WoT Device and a WoT <a>System User</a> might
                      be uniquely identified and its communications tracked.
                      Similar tracking can be done even without identifiers by using 
		      fingerprinting techniques based on
                      a WoT System configuration information (which is likely to be unique).</td>
                 <td>A TD should avoid exposing publically any persistent unique identifiers 
		      (especially immutable ones)
                      that can be used to track it. 
		      Ideally, a TD's identifier (id) should be changed
                      periodically (potentially even every time the WoT Exposed Thing is created, if it does
                      not infer the normal operation mode of a WoT Thing).
		      This however conflicts with the needs of Linked Data and the registration of

		      A compromise needs to be struck.  Mechanisms to notify
		      legitimate users of a Thing when a Thing's identifier has changed may be considered
		      if frequent updates are necessary.
		      It should be at least possible to change a Thing's identifier
		      by re-provisioning the device if necessary.
                      Using methods to limit disclosure of WoT System configuration and TDs also helps to prevent
                      tracking of WoT System users.</td>

  <h1>References to Existing Security Best Practices</h1>
    <p>
      Best practices in security are constantly evolving,
      and it is important to keep up to date.
      At the same time,
      IoT is new enough and is itself evolving rapidly enough that best practices
      are just now emerging and are likely to require rapid updating.  
      Recently attempts have been made to document and categorize useful approaches to security in IoT.
      The following are some of the more useful points of reference:
      <ul>
      <li>[[Garcia17]] - <cite>State-of-the-Art and Challenges for the Internet of Things Security</cite>:<br/>
      This IETF document, a product of the IETF T2TRG, is still in draft form but is now a candidate for
      ratification. 
      It covers a range of recommendations for securing IoT systems.  
      Readers should look for the latest version using the IETF RFC tracker.</li>
      <li>[[IicSF16]] - <cite>The Industrial Internet of Things Volume G4: Security Framework</cite>:<br/>
      Focuses on industrial IoT systems and use cases, and so as discussed above
      emphasizes safety over privacy considerations.
      However, this document includes many practices that are also relevant to other IoT use cases.
      </li>
      <li>[[IETFACE]] - <cite>IETF Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE)</cite>:<br/>
      Discusses the use of existing IETF standards for constrained environments 
      (such as CoAP and DTLS) of relevance to IoT.
      This document also defines a generic IoT security architecture that is followed by several IoT standards.
      </li>

      including lifecycle management.

      </ul>
    </p><p>
      Here are some additional general references for threat modeling and security architecture planning.
      These frameworks can be helpful when designing the security architecture of a specific IoT system or 
      standard.  OWASP in particular is useful for Things using the HTTP protocol for their network interface.

	Depending on the usage scenario, these may not be adequate for securing

	considered to identify and mitigate any additional threats for 
	a specific WoT System.

      <section>
        <h2>Secure Practices for designing a Thing Description</h2>

         <p><strong>Secure Delivery and Storage of Thing Description.</strong></p>
         <p>            
    	      When a TD is transferred between WoT endpoints, to or from the TD
              hosting service, it is important to use secure protocols guaranteeing
    	      data authenticity, freshness and in many cases confidentiality 
              (depending on whenever a TD contains any confidential or
              privacy-sensitive information). 
	      TDs should not be provided without first authenticating the requester
	      and checking that they have authorization to access the requested TDs.
	      If end-to-end TD authenticity or
              confidentiality is required, see <a href="#sec-pract-end-to-end-security"></a>
              for more specific guidance. 
              When a TD is stored at the end device, in a gateway (e.g. in a cache or directory
	      service) or in remote storage (e.g. an archive),
              its authenticity and in some cases confidentiality should
              also be protected using the best available local methods. 
            </p>
            <p>
  	      This recommendation helps prevent the following threats: 
              <a>WoT Communication Threat - TD Authenticity</a>,
              <a>WoT Communication Threat - TD Confidentiality and Privacy</a>,
              <a>Disclosing WoT Thing/Device configuration</a>,
              <a>Disclosing WoT System configuration</a>,
              <a>Tracking WoT System User</a>.
            </p>

         <p><strong>Avoid Exposing Persistent Unique Identifiers</strong></p>
            <p>
             When defining fields exposed by a TD immutable information should be avoided,
	     especially if that information can be tied to a particular person or 
	     is associated with personally identifiable information.
             It is specifically strongly recommended to avoid exposing 
	     any immutable hardware identifiers.
             Instead it is recommended to use "soft identifiers", 
	     i.e. identifiers that can be changed at some point during the device's lifecycle.
	     Given the requirements of Linked Data, it may not be possible to change
	     the identifier during the Operational state of a device without additional
	     infrastructure to register consumers of a TD and notify them of updates, but it should 
	     at least be possible during (re-)provisioning.
            </p>
            <p>
            This recommendation helps prevent the following threats: 
            <a>WoT Communication Threat - TD Confidentiality and Privacy</a>,
            <a>Disclosing WoT System configuration</a>,
            <a>Tracking WoT System User</a>.
            </p>

         <p><strong>Minimize Publicly Exposed Information in TD</strong></p>
            <p>
             WoT TDs should minimize the amount of information that
             is publicly available about a WoT Thing.             
	     For example, the TD should generally not identify the version of the software or
	     operating system a device is running, since this information can be used
	     to identify vulnerable systems.  
	     Instead the TD should capture all information
	     needed to support interoperability without reference to particular implementations.
            </p>
            <p>
            This recommendation helps prevent the following threats: 
            <a>WoT Communication Threat - TD Confidentiality and Privacy</a>,
            <a>Disclosing WoT Thing/Device configuration</a>,
            <a>Disclosing WoT System configuration</a>,
            <a>Tracking WoT System User</a>,
            <a>WoT DoS Threat</a>.
            </p>

         <p><strong>Limit TDs exposure</strong></p>
            <p>
             Limit clients who can obtain a certain TD (or its privacy-sensitive parts)
             via authentication and authorization methods.
             This can be done by exposing a number of TD variants for the same 
             WoT Thing based on the level of client’s access.           
	     For example, versions of a TD for "public access" may be generated with a subset
	     of information in the full TD, omitting (for example) support or version metadata.
            </p>
            <p>
            This recommendation helps prevent the following threats:

            <p> 
             When defining protocols for APIs exposed by a TD,

	     Specifically, HTTPS (using TLS), CoAPS (using DTLS), and
	     MQTTS (using TLS) should be used if any kind of authentication

             If data travels many intermediate nodes (potentially malicious

              When defining WoT Interfaces exposed by a TD,
              it is important to avoid any heavy functional processing

              Any publicly exposed network interface should avoid heavy processing altogether.

         <p><strong>Minimize Network Interface Functionality and Complexity</strong></p>
          <p>
           Network interfaces exposed by a TD (WoT Interfaces) should only provide
           the minimal necessary functionality, which helps to minimize implementation errors,
           possibilities for exposing potentially sensitive data, DoS attack possibilities etc.
           Devices should be strongly encapsulated, meaning the network interfaces should not
           expose implementation details (for example, the use of particular software frameworks).

              If end-to-end authenticity is desired,
              it is possible to sign WoT objects (TDs, <a>System User Data</a>) with either
              digital signatures (using asymmetric cryptographic primitives) or Message
              Authentication Codes (MACs, using symmetric cryptographic primitives).
              Such digital signatures or MACs are created by the producers/issuers of the objects
              and validated by consumers of the objects 
	      (which should reject signed the objects whose signatures/MACs are invalid).

    <h1>Examples of WoT Security Configurations</h1>
        <p>
          The WoT is intended to be used in variety of use cases and deployment configurations.
          While the examples in this section do not cover all possible deployment variations, they cover
          many common cases, shows how security mechanisms can be configured for these cases,
          and highlights some details relevant to security.
        </p>

           <section id="wot-client-server-basic">
           <h2>Basic Interaction between WoT Thing and WoT Consumer</h2>
            <p>
              <a href="#wot_client_thing_basic"></a> shows the basic WoT Consumer
	      (which can be a browser or an application on a user's smartphone)
              used to directly operate a WoT Thing.
	      The WoT Thing exposes a WoT Interface and also directly provides
              a Thing Description.
              The Thing Description describes the interactions that can be performed on the WoT Thing.
            </p>

              <figcaption>Basic WoT Thing and WoT Consumer</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
            From a security point of view two aspects are important to consider in this scenario.
            First, the WoT Consumer should be certain that it is talking to the correct WoT Thing 
	    and not to some other device exposed on the same network.
            Users intending to control a specific device, for example opening a garage door,
            want to make sure they are talking to their own garage door device.
            In security terms this means that WoT Consumer must have a way to
            authenticate the device exposing the WoT Thing.
            Second, upon receiving requests from a WoT Consumer,
            the WoT Thing must verify the the WoT Consumer is authorized to perform such requests.
            For example, a garage door must only process "open" requests from devices associated with 
            authorized users or service providers and not from arbitrary passerby.
            </p>
            <p>
            These requirements can both be fulfilled using a variety of different security mechanisms.
            The choice of concrete security mechanisms depends on the deployment scenario,
            as well as capabilities of the devices.
            Either or both the WoT Consumer and the WoT Thing might have some resource,
	    network connectivity, or user interface constraints that may limit the choice of security mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
            For example, suppose the WoT Thing is actually an OCF device that has been provided with
            a Thing Description.  This is a reasonable use case since WoT metadata can be used to describe
            OCF devices, which have RESTful CoAP and/or HTTP network interfaces.  Since the WoT only
	    describes devices during operational phase, and does not describe onboarding or provisioning
	    processes, we have to refer to an external standard (such as OCF) that does specify these
            processes.  However, it should be clear that much of what is described in this example is
            applicable to other standards or even to custom solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
	    The WoT Consumer and the OCF device providing the network interface acting as the WoT Thing can
            use one of the following methods
	    recommended by the OCF Security Specification [[Ocf17]] (see Section 10) to mutually authenticate
            each other given that there is a way to supply credential information required for authentication
            during provisioning:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Symmetric key credentials.</strong> 
		    This method assumes that both WoT Consumer and the device exposing WoT Thing have pre-shared
		    symmetric key credentials.
		    Such keys can be established during device provisioning/on-boarding phase.
		    In this case, since this is actually an OCF device,
		    it can use one of the methods recommended in Section 7 [[Ocf17]] 
		    or can use an ad-hoc security protocol,
		    such as EC Diffie-Hellmani, based on other existing pre-shared credentials.
		    See Section 9.2.1 [[Ocf17]] for more details on such credential types.</li>
            <li><strong>Raw asymmetric public key credentials.</strong>
		    This method assumes that a WoT Consumer has been provisioned with the public key
		    of the device exposing the WoT Thing (and vice versa) 
		    so the devices are able to mutually authenticate each other.
		    Provisioning of public keys can take place during a device provisioning/on-boarding phase.
		    In the case of OCF devices,
		    this can take place using one of the methods recommended in Section 7 [[Ocf17]].
		    Section 9.2.3 [[Ocf17]] also provides more details on this credential type as well as
		    guidance on its secure provisioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Certificates.</strong> This method assumes that the WoT Consumer has been provisioned
		    with the certificate of the device exposing the WoT Thing (and visa versa) 
		    so the devices are able to mutually authenticate each other.
		    The provisioning of the certificates can take place during device provisioning/on-boarding phase
		    using one of the methods recommended in Section 7 [[Ocf17]].
		    Section 9.2.5 [[Ocf17]] also provides more details on this 
		    credential type as well as Section 9.3.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            In case it is not possible to pre-provision any of the types of credentials described above
	    during the network setup phase or if the WoT Thing wants to use a more fine-grained access control policy
	    on the WoT Interfaces it is exposing 
	    (for example, different controls might require different levels
	    of authorization), the following methods can be used instead:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>OAuth 2.0-based access tokens.</strong> These tokens follow the JSON Web Token (JWT)
		    format defined in RFC 7519 [[JWT15]] and should used according to the suggestions by 
		    the IETF Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) 
		    specification draft [[IETFACE]].
		    These are recommended for devices that are able to use the HTTP protocol and
		    do not have significant resource constraints.</li>
            <li><strong>Proof-of-possession (PoP) tokens.</strong> These are extensions of the OAuth 2.0-based 
		    access tokens that follow the CBOR web token (CWT) format [[CBOR17]].
		    The IETF Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) 
		    specification draft [[IETFACE]]
		    recommends such tokens for resource-constrained devices using the COAP protocol 
		    instead of HTTP.
		    For details of using such tokens please see [[IETFACE]].</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            Instead of assigning different access tokens to different WoT Interfaces,
            it is also possible to group related WoT Interfaces under some group or capability name
            (i.e. "Light controls", "House access" etc.) 
	    and assign one token per group to guard any such interfaces.
            This can provide more balanced access control granularity in many circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
            Suitable choices of the above security measures allows mitigation of the 
	    <a>WoT Interface Threat - Unauthorized WoT Interface Access</a> threat.
            </p>
            <p>
            In addition to the above measures,
	    authenticity, confidentiality and replay protection of transferred solution data and of 
	    TDs between the WoT Consumer and the WoT Thing is strongly recommended for scenarios
	    where an attacker can observe or/and modify the traffic in the WoT System.
            While TD transfer might only require authenticity protection, 
	    the solution data itself usually requires protection of all its aspects.
            This helps to mitigate the following threats:
            <a>WoT Communication Threat - TD Authenticity</a>, 
	    <a>WoT Communication Threat - TD Confidentiality and Privacy</a>,
            <a>WoT Communication Threat - System User Data Authenticity</a>,
            <a>WoT Communication Threat - System User Data Confidentiality and Privacy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Authenticity, confidentiality and replay protection can be guaranteed by usage of secure 
	    transport protocols to exchange data between the WoT Consumer and the WoT Thing, such as TLS/DTLS.
            If the underlying protocol does not provide the required security (such as plain CoAP run over
	    a non-(D)TLS protected channel), then authenticity and confidentiality of the transferred data
	    can be implemented separately on the application layer.
	    The recommended method for doing this in resource constrained environments is to use the 
	    Object Security of CoAP (OSCoAP) method described in the IETF Object Security of CoAP (OSCoAP)
	    specification draft [[OSCOAP17]].
            </p>
            <p>
            The scenario shown in <a href="#wot_client_thing_basic_2"></a> is similar but with the important
	    difference that a Thing description is not stored on the WoT Thing device nor returned by it directly.
            The TD is instead provided to the WoT Consumer from a Thing Directory residing on some other
	    system, such as a cloud server.  
	    This mode may be useful for "retro-fitting" existing devices with Thing Descriptions, for example,
	    or when more secure access to the TD is required than the device itself can support.
            </p>

              <figcaption>Basic WoT Thing and WoT Consumer with TD provided from a Thing Directory</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
            The primary additional security consideration of this scenario is the need for the secure transfer
            of the TD between the WoT Consumer and the Thing Directory.
	    The Thing Directory can reside in a Intermediary WoT Servient but could also be supported by a service running
	    on a remote cloud or other remote location.
	    Similarly to the methods described above such transfer should be done using secure transport protocols.
            In the case that the WoT Consumer is not resource constrained,
            the usage of TLS/DTLS is the recommended method.
            In case the remote cloud does not guarantee the secure storage and delivery of
            Thing Descriptions to the WoT Consumer or in case the remote cloud is not a trusted entity,
	    the authenticity of the Thing Description should be verified using other methods on the application layer,
            such as wrapping the Thing Description into a protected 
	    CBOR Object Encryption and Signing (COSE) object [[COSE17]].
            This can be done by the provider of the Thing Description and verified by the 
	    WoT Consumer after the download from the remote cloud.

          <h2>Interaction between WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via an Intermediary WoT Servient</h2>
            <p>
            A <a href="#wot_client_thing_gateway"></a>, 
	    as in the <a href="#wot_client_thing_basic"></a> configuration,
            also allows a WoT Consumer to connect to and operate or monitor a WoT Thing.
            However in contrast to the basic (direct connection) case,
            the interaction between the WoT Consumer and the WoT Thing is now mediated by an Intermediary WoT Servient.
            The Intermediary WoT Servient exposes a WoT interface and provides a Thing Description that describes 
            interactions that that apply to the Thing.
            In general, the TD provided by the Intermediary WoT Servient is structurally
            identical to the one that would have been provided by the Thing directly,
            except for any necessary modifications to URLs, protocols used,
	    and (perhaps) a modified security configuration.
            </p>
            <figure id="wot_client_thing_gateway">
              <img src="images/client-server-gateway.png" style="width: 1000px;" />
              <figcaption>WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via Intermediary WoT Servient</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
            From a security standpoint this case is quite similar to the one described in 
	    Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"></a>. 
            The main difference is that mutual authentication should be established between 
	    all directly communicating parties,
            i.e. between the WoT Consumer and the Intermediary WoT Servient,
            as well as between the Intermediary WoT Servient and the device exposing the WoT Thing network interface.
            If there is no direct communication between the Intermediary WoT Servient
            and the device providing the WoT Thing however the mutual authentication between them is redundant.
            The authentication mechanisms described in Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"></a>
            are also applicable for this case.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Thing Description that the Intermediary WoT Servient device provides to the WoT Consumer 
            can be the same as it gets from the device exposing the WoT Thing or it can be modified 
            to better suit the deployment use case or expose additional functionality via the Intermediary WoT Servient.
            It is also possible that the end device behind the Intermediary WoT Servient is a non-WoT Device and does
            not provide any Thing Description on its own, 
	    and may not support any interaction via a WoT-compatible network Interface.
            In this case the Intermediary WoT Servient has to build the Thing Description by itself i
	    and expose it to the WoT Consumer.
            For all typical use cases,
            the Intermediary WoT Servient should be considered a trusted entity and in this case
            it can freely modify or build Thing Descriptions it exposes as well as set up 
            fine-grained access controls on different exposed WoT Interfaces.
            The Intermediary WoT Servient can do this using the same methods described in
            Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"></a>, i
	    and therefore acts fully on behalf of the end device.
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="#wot_client_thing_gateway_2"></a> is similar to the previous case 
	    but with an important difference:
            a Thing Description is not provided by the the Intermediary WoT Servient,
            but can be fetched by the WoT Consumer from a Thing Directory residing on a remote system.
            Similar to the previous case,
            this Thing Description can either be the original Thing Description supplied by the end device
            or modified by the Intermediary WoT Servient.
            Regardless of the actual setup,
            the transfer of a Thing Description between any two endpoints should be done 
	    using underlying secure protocols.
            Currently the use of TLS or DTLS is recommended.
            Similarly to Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"></a>, 
	    in case the remote system does not guarantee
            the secure storage and delivery of Thing Descriptions to the WoT Consumer
            or in case the remote system is not a trusted entity,
            the authenticity of the Thing Description should be verified 
	    using other methods in the application layer.

           <h2>Basic Interaction between WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via a Split Proxy</h2>

           <p>
            <a href="#wot_client_thing_double_proxy"></a> shows another common situation
            where the WoT Thing resides in a local protected network, e.g. behind a NAT/Firewall.
            In this case the WoT Consumer cannot contact the WoT Thing directly.
            In the configuration shown here the communication between the WoT Consumer and the WoT Thing 
            is handled via a pair of Intermediary WoT Servients: 
            one residing in the local protected network, known as the Local Intermediary WoT Servient,
            and another running in the cloud, known as the Remote Intermediary WoT Servient.
            We refer to this configuration as a "Split Proxy" because the 
	    combination of the Local and Remote Intermediary together
            act like a single proxy service.
            The Local and Remote Intermediary WoT Servients are connected with a secure channel 
	    (which may be non-WoT, eg it does not have to use a protocol known to WoT) 
	    as the Local Intermediary WoT Servient only communicates over this channel with the Remote Intermediary WoT Servient.
            The WoT Remote Intermediary WoT Servient should use the mechanisms described in 
	    Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"></a>
            in order to authenticate and authorize the WoT Consumer before processing any of its requests.
            Similar to the configurations described in Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"></a>,
            secure protocols should be used to protect authenticity and confidentiality 
	    and provide replay protection when
            data is exchanged between the WoT Consumer and the Remote Intermediary WoT Servient.
            If the WoT Consumer is authorized,
            then the Remote Intermediary WoT Servient can package the WoT request 
	    and transfer it over the secure channel to the Local Intermediary WoT Servient,
            which in turn can issue requests to the WoT Thing on the local network.
            The local network channel between the Local Intermediary WoT Servient and the WoT Thing can be left unprotected
            (relying purely on the closed nature of the local network),
            but it is strongly recommended to employ suitable additional security mechanisms 
            as described in Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"></a> to perform authentication
            and authorization of involved parties (WoT Thing and Local Intermediary WoT Servient),
            as well as to provide confidentiality and integrity of transferred solution data and the TD.
           </p>

            <figure id="wot_client_thing_double_proxy">

              <figcaption>WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via Split Proxy</figcaption>
            </figure>

           <p>
            An alternative security setup for this scenario can use end-to-end security 
	    authentication and authorization.
            In this case the WoT Consumer would not only need to authenticate and authorize 
	    itself to the Remote Intermediary WoT Servient,
            but also to the WoT Thing.
            In this case it would need a separate set of security credentials,
            required to successfully authenticate with each party.
	    The exposed TD should indicate the mechanisms to obtain these credentials, e.g. via OAuth2.          
          </p>

          <section id="wot-client-server-tunnel">
           <h2>Basic Interaction between WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via a Tunnel</h2>

           <p>As an alternative to the use of a split proxy, 
	   which requires a trusted remote proxy to accept interaction
           requests on behalf of the WoT Thing, 
	   a secure tunnel (such as an SSH tunnel) can be set up between the WoT Thing and
           an endpoint in the cloud.  
	   In order to traverse the NAT the WoT Thing would have to initiate the connection, so
           in practice this would be a reverse tunnel set up by the "server". 
	   However, then a port made available by the Thing would be made
           available directly on the cloud server supporting the tunnel endpoint, 
	   possibly mapped to a different port.
	   The use of a tunnel for NAT traversal is shown in <a href="#wot_client_thing_tunnel"></a>.
           </p>
           <figure id="wot_client_thing_tunnel">
              <img src="images/tunnel.png" style="width: 1000px;" />
              <figcaption>WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via Tunnel</figcaption>
            </figure>
		  
           <p>
           In this configuration the WoT Thing must be responsible for all security, 
	   including (if necessary) certificates
           appropriate for the tunnel endpoint in the cloud.  i
	   This implies that the WoT Thing needs to be relatively powerful, 
	   as constrained devices may not be able to support security mechanisms suitable for
           direct exposure on the Internet.  
	   The WoT Thing would also have to be actively maintained and patched.
           If the WoT Thing provides a TD, it should use URLs that refer to the tunnel endpoint.  
	   This generally means that the port used for the local side of the tunnel
           should not be used to provide local connections as the certificates will be 
	   incorrect for local connections.
           Instead a separate port (and possibly a separate TD with local URLs) should be provided.
           </p>	  
           <p>One advantage of this arrangement is that communication is never available in plaintext on either the
           gateway or the client.  Specifically, the private keys for end-to-end communication between the 
	   WoT Thing and the WoT Consumer, assuming a secure protocol such as HTTPS is used, never need to be made
	   available to either the local gateway or to the cloud portal.
           In other words, this configuration supports end-to-end encrypted communication, and does not rely
           on trusting either the gateway or the cloud portal.
           Because of this, it is not technically necessary for the tunnel to be over SSH; 
	   a regular IP tunnel would suffice.
	   </p>
	   <p>A variation of this is shown in <a href="#wot_client_thing_proxy"></a>.  
	   A reverse tunnel is still
           used here, but terminates in a local port "inside" the cloud portal, 
	   that is, the local port is not made visible outside
	   the cloud portal's firewall.  
	   A local proxy service then runs inside the cloud portal and provides
	   a bridge to a secure external network interface.  
	   For example, the protocol from the WoT Thing might be HTTP,
           which the proxy service could bridge to an external HTTPS network interface.  
	   In this case, the
           tunnel should be encrypted (for example, using SSH) to prevent eavesdropping; 
	   a regular IP tunnel is not sufficient.
           Depending on the configuration, 
           the unencrypted traffic (eg HTTP) may also be visible on the local network.   
	   In this case, the only protection
           would be from that provided by the local network, eg WPA.
           If such a relatively unprotected local interface is <emph>not</emph> desirable,
	   another SSH tunnel can be used between the WoT Thing and the Intermediary WoT Servient, 
	   or the WoT Thing can act as
           its own gateway (with the HTTP traffic protected behind a firewall).
           </p>
	   <p>To support local SSH tunnels, of course credentials need to be provisioned between the gateway and the
	   cloud portal.  However, this only needs to be done once, when the gateway is installed.
	   </p>
           <p>It is worth emphasizing that the security in this configuration is weaker than in the end-to-end
           tunnel configuration.  In particular, unencrypted traffic is available both locally (on the local network
           and/or inside the gateway) and in the cloud portal.  Therefore both the gateway and the cloud portal
           need to be trusted.  This can be mitigated somewhat by using application-level end-to-end object security
           [[COSE17]].
           </p>

              <figcaption>WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via HTTPS/HTTP Proxy</figcaption>
            </figure>

           <p>Yet another variant of this approach is shown in <a href="#wot_client_thing_proxy"></a>.
	   In this variant, the proxy is extended to support caching.
           This means that the proxy may not always forward requests to the 
           WoT Thing, but may instead respond on its behalf using stored state.
           </p>
           <p>There are two sub-variants of this approach.
           First, a simple HTTP Proxy can be used that caches responses from the WoT Thing.
           For example, property reads might return an exact copy of an earlier cached payload if only a small
           amount of time (for some configurable value of "small") 
	   has elapsed since the last request for that property.
           However, this approach still requires that the WoT Thing be "always on"
           and able to respond as a server in case cached content is not available or has expired.
           It also requires some care on the part of the WoT Thing to mark payloads as cacheable
           or uncacheable and configure appropriate time-to-live values.
           </p>
            <figure id="wot_client_thing_cachingproxy">
              <img src="images/cachingproxy.png" style="width: 1000px;" />
              <figcaption>WoT Thing and WoT Consumer via HTTPS/HTTP Proxy</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The second sub-variant, shown in <a href="#wot_client_thing_cachingproxy"></a>,
           takes advantage of the metadata provided by the Thing Description.
           Specifically, the Thing Description indicates which interactions are "properties" that can be "observed".
           The proxy service can "observe" all such properties and maintain copies of their state in the cloud server
           (it is also possible to do this in the gateway, a sub-variant of this pattern).
           Then when a request comes in to read a property, it can be read from the stored state.  However, the 
           "observe" pattern allows the WoT Thing to send updates on its own schedule, leading to greater power
	   efficiency.  In addition, the proxy service can see from the Thing Description which network interface
           methods are "actions" and need to be sent directly to the WoT Thing.  This reduces the need for the 
           WoT Thing to mark interactions as being cacheable or not.
		    <!--
           The cache functionality can either be combined with the security endpoint proxy or can be instantiated
           as a separate service.  Conceptually the functions are distinct. -->
           </p>
           <p>In both of these sub-patterns, object security (that is, encryption and authentication of payloads
	   at the application level) can be used to preserve confidentiality and integrity if necessary [[COSE17]].
	   A caching proxy can
	   simply store and return copies of the encrypted data representing the state of "private" properties.
           </p>
           <p>A caching proxy, being a variant of the proxy configuration discussed above,
           has similar security caveats.

           <h2>WoT Servient Single-Tenant</h2>
           <p>
           In previous examples we have considered the Wot Servient as a black box 
	   exposing a set of WoT Interfaces and Thing Descriptions. 
	   <a href="#wot_servient-single-tenant"></a> shows the WoT Servient 
	   (for example consider again a garage door controller device or an Intermediary WoT Servient) 
	   in more detail with Scripting API support and a couple of scripts running inside a WoT runtime. 
	   For this case we consider all scripts to be trusted and provisioned 
	   to the device by a single trusted entity (for example by the manufacturer during factory installation).
            </p>
            <figure id="wot_servient-single-tenant">
              <img src="images/servient-single-tenant.png" style="width: 500px;" />
              <figcaption>WoT Servient Single-Tenant</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
            Since all scripts running inside the WoT runtime are considered trusted for this scenario, 
	    there is no strong need to perform strict isolation between each running script instance. 
	    However, depending on device capabilities and deployment use case scenario risk level 
	    it might be desirable to do so. 
	    For example, if one script handles sensitive privacy-related data and well-audited, 
	    it might be desirable to separate it from the rest of the script instances to minimize the 
	    risk of data exposure in case some other script inside WoT gets compromised during the runtime. 
	    Such isolation can be performed within the WoT Runtime 
	    using platform security mechanisms available on the device.
            </p>
            <p>
            Depending on the device capabilities, the following isolation mechanisms might be available:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>WoT Runtime enforced isolation.</strong> 
	    This is the basic isolation provided by the WoT Runtime itself 
	    and is based on restricting the API exposed to the scripts running within the WoT Runtime. 
	    The exact set of guarantees depends on the concrete WoT Runtime implementation and might vary.</li>
            <li><strong>Native OS process-based isolation.</strong> 
	    This method relies on the underlying native OS to provide basic isolation guarantees 
	    based on native process isolation. 
	    The exact set of guarantees depends on capabilities of native OS, 
	    but it usually includes at least memory and execution content isolation. 
	    Some other mechanisms like Discretionary Access Controls (DAC) might be also available. </li>
            <li><strong>Native OS advanced isolation.</strong> 
	    An OS might also provide a stronger set of measures that can be deployed for process-based isolation. 
	    Examples of such measures are Mandatory access Control (MACs in all major OSes), 
	    OS-level virtualization (i.e. namespaces and containers in Linux), Cryptographic methods etc. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            The mechanisms are provided in the order from weakest to the strongest isolation method 
	    and can be used in combination. 
	    In order to choose the appropriate mechanism one should study the capabilities of the underlying device, 
	    as well as evaluate the risk level of particular deployment scenario. 
	    <!--
	    See Section <a href="#determine-suitable-architecture"></a> for more details on how to evaluate the risk level. 
	    -->
	    It is also important to note that all isolation mechanisms usually affect performance 
	    and might require non-trivial policy setup and management.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now if we consider the basic communication scenario between the WoT Consumer 
	    and the device exposing the WoT Thing described in Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"></a> 
	    from a perspective of script instances running inside WoT Runtime, 
	    each such instance should be able to have a way to perform mutual authentication 
	    between itself and a remote WoT Consumer or support a token-based authentication method. 
	    However, there are no methods in the WoT Scripting API to perform any such tasks.
	    Instead the underlying WoT Runtime and protocol bindings handle the required 
	    security functionality transparently for the WoT scripts. 
	    <a href="#wot_scripts_security_1"></a> shows how it is done, 
	    when a WoT Script discovers a new WoT Thing, MyLampThing, 
	    using the discover() scripting API method, and invokes an action "toggle".

            <a href="#wot_scripts_security_2"></a> shows handling of security configuration 
	    during the exposure of a new WoT Thing, MyLampThing. 
	    Since the security configurations 
	    (types of authentication and authorization methods and corresponding credentials) 
	    are not exposed to the WoT Scripts, 
	    but handled by the WoT Runtime and underlying protocol bindings, 
	    WoT Scripts must either rely on the WoT Runtime to use the default credentials provisioned to it, 
	    or indicate the choice of security methods and credentials 
	    using a name/id tag known to the WoT Runtime.

            <h2>WoT Servient Multi-Tenant</h2>
            <p>
              <a href="#wot_servient-multi-tenant"></a> shows the WoT Servient 
	      with two different tenants running in two different instances of WoT Runtime. 
	      There is a no trust relation between different tenants and they can be untrusted. 
	      Each tenant can have multiple independent WoT scripts running inside their WoT Runtime. 
	      WoT Runtime core also has a Thing Manager entity that allows installation of scripts 
	      into the corresponding WoT Runtimes.
            </p>
            <figure id="wot_servient-multi-tenant">
              <img src="images/servient-multi-tenant.png" style="width: 600px;" />
              <figcaption>WoT Servient Multi-Tenant</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
            The case of the multi-tenant servient with a possibility to install WoT Scripts remotely 
	    into WoT Runtimes brings an additional set of threats that must be taken into account: 
	    <a>WoT Script Management Interface Threat</a>, 
	    <a>WoT Untrusted Script Threat - Script Compromise</a>,
	    <a>WoT Untrusted Script Threat - Runtime Compromise</a>,
	    <a>WoT Untrusted Script Threat - Authenticity</a>,
	    <a>WoT Untrusted Script Threat - Confidentiality</a>,
	    <a>WoT Untrusted Script Threat - TD Authenticity</a>,
	    <a>WoT Untrusted Script Threat - TD Confidentiality and Privacy</a>,
	    <a>WoT Untrusted Script Threat - System User Data Authenticity</a>,
	    <a>WoT Untrusted Script Threat - System User Data Confidentiality and Privacy</a>,
	    and
	    <a>WoT Untrusted Script Threat - DoS</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            In order to address these threats one should utilize the strongest isolation method available 
	    on the device to separate different WoT Runtimes. 
	    The isolation should cover execution context, 
	    runtime memory, local storage and resource allocation between different WoT Runtimes.
            </p>
            <p>
            In addition the Thing Manager should have a reliable way to distinguish 
	    between different tenants in order to securely manage provisioning and updates of scripts 
	    into the corresponding WoT Runtime. 
	    This can be achieved by authenticating the tenant 
	    using one of the authentication methods described in Section <a href="#wot-client-server-basic"></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Also each tenant inside the WoT runtime requires a different set of security credentials 
	    to be provisioned and made accessible for its scripts. 
	    These credentials should be also strictly isolated between different tenants.
            </p>

    <section id="security-validation">
      <h1>Security Validation</h1>
          <p>This section provides guidance on how a WoT System implementation can be
          tested in order to evaluate its security and privacy.  
          A <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-security-best-practices/">WoT Security Best Practices</a> 
          document describes best practices for securing WoT implementations.  
          This section focuses on systems that follow those best practice since systems that do
          not generally will have known vulnerabilities and testing
          to reveal them would be redundant.
          </p>WoT Systems can consist both of purpose-built components and pre-existing
          components.  
          Purpose-built WoT components should be
          implemented using WoT security best practices.  
          However, pre-existing systems may also have WoT Thing Descriptions written 
          for them so that other WoT components can interface with them.  
          Such "retrofitted" pre-existing components
          may also have pre-existing security weaknesses and vulnerabilities.  
          Security testing may reveal these
          as well, but it should be understood that describing a network interface
          using a WoT Thing Description does not guarantee that it will be secure: in order
          to accommodate pre-existing devices, WoT Thing Descriptions need to be flexible
          enough to describe both secure <em>and</em> insecure interfaces.
          Security mitigations need to consider the entire system and should in
          particular take into account that not all components of the system may be
          equally secure.
          </p>
      <section>
      <h2>Testing Goals</h2>
          <p>
          The goal of WoT security testing is to find security vulnerabilities in
          the implementation of WoT components, so they can be mitigated.  
          This can be broadened to finding weaknesses (potential vulnerabilities)
          since mitigating both actual and potential vulnerabilities is
          sufficient to secure a system, and in general it can be hard to determine
          if a weakness is exploitable.
          It is not possible in general to prove the converse, 
          that a WoT component is secure (that is, that it has no vulnerabilities).  
          However, thorough security testing can at least ensure
          that there are no obvious (easily discoverable) weaknesses or 
          vulnerabilities in an implementation.
          </p><p>
          Furthermore, the goal of security testing for an implementor is to identify the existence of
          weaknesses, not to exploit them to break into or manipulate a system.
          For an implementor, the priority after discovery of a weakness is to 
          implement a mitigation to prevent it from being exploited,
          not to actually find or create an exploit and use it.  
          Not all weaknesses are vulnerabilities.  
          Fixing actual (exploitable) vulnerabilities should have a higher priority than
          simple weaknesses,
          so an implementor may want to also determine which weaknesses are
          exploitable in order to prioritize mitigations.
          </p><p>
          In the following we provide some background on testing, including
          a description of several varieties of security testing and examples of suitable
          tools for each.
          While we provide some tool examples in the following,
          they are just examples; you are free to use any tool that fits the purpose.
          After introducing the categories of testing and examples of tools for each,
          we then present a general security testing plan for WoT Systems based on these categories.
          </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <p>Before beginning security testing, it is useful to determine if the components 
      of the system being tested have been implemented following good and up-to-date security practices.
      What we really want to do is identify systems that use known insecure practices, 
      for which vulnerabilities are known. Many times such vulnerabilities will be
      obvious from the WoT Thing Description, and can be identified with simple tools.
      </p><p>
      As an example, suppose a WoT Thing combines "basic" authentication with plain (unencrypted) HTTP.
      In this case the username and password can be easily recovered from the header
      information of the unencrypted HTTP request by an eavesdropper with access to the 
      network traffic, for example by code running in a compromised router or by someone
      who has broken WiFi encryption.
      </p><p>
      As another example, an older device may use an obsolete form of encryption for which
      an attack is known.
      </p><p>
      Hiding the Thing Descriptions of such systems is not really a solution: this is
      equivalent to security by obscurity which is widely considered to be ineffective.
      Generally, the "secret information" 
      allowing access to a system should be in the form of easily modifiable keys,
      not engineering details which, once revealed, cannot be easily changed.
      However, certainly mitigating obvious vulnerabilities
      easily discoverable in the Thing Description should be a high priority.
      Ideally mitigation is accomplished by modifying the implementation but this
      is not possible in all cases. If the implementation cannot be modified it may be
      possible to achieve partial mitigation by securing the network environment, e.g. by
      using a VPN or encrypted tunnels to encapsulate the vulnerable network traffic.
      </p><p>
      Another point to note is that a Thing Description may not describe all the
      network interfaces of a Thing. A Thing may have a Thing Description that describes
      a network interface that follows best practices and may pass all the additional
      security tests described below on that interface, but may still have an insecure
      backdoor (additional network interface) not described in the Thing Description.  
      It is the implementor's
      responsibility to secure <em>all</em> network interfaces, even if the Thing Description is
      subsetted.  Note that there are valid reasons to subset a Thing Description,
      for example to provide different interfaces to users with different roles and
      access rights.
      </p><p>
      A WoT System may also have infrastructure components that do not have Thing Descriptions.
      There may, for example, be services such as proxies or directories.  These
      should also be tested.  If they are web services or otherwise have documented
      network interfaces, then much of the testing
      procedure described below should also apply to them.
      <p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Functional Security Testing</h2>
      <p>Functional testing checks that a WoT Thing implements the interactions
      described in its Thing Description. This includes whether or not it 
      responds to all URLs given and accepts and returns data as specified 
      in the data schemas given in the Thing Description for each interaction.
      </p><p>
      Functional testing should also check that all security mechanisms 
      described in the Thing Description are implemented properly.
      Does the Thing do what the Thing Description says it does in terms of security, 
      and only that?
      Does the Thing Description accurately describe the security mechanisms
      used by the Thing?
      Do all interactions accept authorized accesses, and reject accesses
      that do not provide correct authentication and authorization information?
      </p><p>
      Again, there can be both purpose-built and pre-existing devices described 
      by a Thing Description.  A Thing Description needs to accurately describe
      the security behavior and requirements in both cases. 
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Adversarial Security Testing</h2>
      <p>Adversarial security testing (also known as penetration testing or pentesting) 
      includes various checks that can be done in order
      to find weaknesses in the target device or service and determine their
      severity and exploitability (that is, whether they are actual vulnerabilities).
      On a high level adversarial testing consists of three stages, which
      are often applied iteratively:
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Information gathering:</strong> 
          Required information is collected about the attack target.
          <li><strong>Weakness discovery:</strong>
          An attack target is analyzed and weaknesses are found.
          <li><strong>Exploitation generation:</strong> 
          An attempt is made to convert weaknesses into vulnerabilities
          by discovering or designing exploits.
      </ol>
      <p>Exploits are designed to achieve a desired outcome, 
      such as privilege escalation, authorization bypass, denial of service, and other goals.
      A successful exploit of one vulnerability 
      may be used to expose other weaknesses and allow them in turn to be exploitable.
      Conversely, a weakness may be prevented from exploitation by a mitigation that
      prevents the class of exploit to which it is vulnerable.
      </p>
      <p>Many resources and tools exist to help penetration and security testers to
      perform the above activities.  Many documents and tutorials have also been written
      to help guide this activity. One example of such guide is the "Web Service
      Security Testing Cheat Sheet" [[Owa18]] written by the Open Web Application
      Security Project (OWASP).  Generally speaking, WoT components can be treated
      as web services for the purposes of security testing, especially if they use HTTP.  
      However, WoT components also
      have some additional considerations, 
      for example local access while using HTTPS, or
      use of non-HTTP protocols such as CoAP or MQTT.
      </p><p>
      For the purposes of WoT security testing we will focus on Stage 2,
      <em>Weakness Discovery</em>.  
      Weakness discovery can be broken down into a combination of
      static weakness discovery and runtime weakness discovery.
      </p><p>
      Stage 1 is not really necessary in the case of white-box
      testing, which we will assume (given that, for example, a Thing Description already
      documents much of the information needed). Generally speaking, trying to achieve
      security through obscurity is not feasible or desirable, so for testing we should assume the
      attacker knows as much about the system as the implementor.
      Also, since our goal is to test the 
      security of the components of a WoT System, not actually break into it,
      we also will not focus on Stage 3.
      However, an exploitable vulnerability has a higher priority for correction 
      than a simple weakness for which no exploit is (yet) known, so this information
      is still useful to prioritize mitigation.

    <h3>Static Weakness Discovery</h3>
      <p>Static weakness discovery typically requires an access to the target's source code,
      and therefore is not always possible to perform for a black-box penetration tester.
      However, since a WoT Thing developer or WoT Service provider have the access,
      they are strongly encouraged to use the below methods to check for weaknesses (potential
      vulnerabilities) in their components as part of white-box testing. 
      Static weakness discovery is very well supported and automated.
      Many tools are available, so after an initial setup phase,
      it should add little overhead to the WoT component development and release process.
      </p>

      <section id="static-code-analysis">
      <h4>Static Code Analysis</h4>
      <p>The most common example of static weakness discovery is usage of a
      static code analyzer tool that is able to parse a program's code and
      highlight potential development mistakes and insecure practices, 
      such usage of insecure functions or libraries,
      forgotten boundary checks when operating on arrays, and many other sources
      of security weakness.
      Usually the output of such a tool is in the form of a report that
      needs to be manually triaged to determine if each reported issue is a false positive
      or a real mistake. 
      While static development tools are constantly improving and 
      over time are able
      to offer better and better coverage, lower false positive rates, 
      and discover more weaknesses, 
      it is important to remember that these tools (as any others) do
      not guarantee finding all weaknesses in the scanned component.
      Other methods should be used to complement static analysis.</p>

      <p><strong>Examples of tools:</strong>
      Many commercial and open source tools exist that primarily differ on the
      source code languages that they can process as input. Our major suggestion
      would be to choose a well-established, mature tool that is actively
      supported and developed. Some examples include Klocwork [[Klocwork]],
      Coverity [[Coverity]], and Checkmarx [[Checkmarx]].
      Also, while some of these tools are commercial and require a license
      to use, they often do provide a free scanning service for open source projects.
      One example of such service is the online Coverity service [[CoverityOnline]].
      </p>
      </section>

      <section id="known-vulnerability-checking">
      <h4>Known vulnerability checking</h4>
      <p>In addition to checking for development mistakes in new code,
      it is also important to check that programs do not include
      vulnerable third-party libraries or utilities with known weaknesses or 
      vulnerabilities. There are many tools developed
      for this purpose and on a high level they work by scanning executable binaries
      (or source code for non-compiled languages) or application packages in a search
      for vulnerable components, such as old versions of libraries that are vulnerable
      to known attacks. 
      The information about weaknesses and vulnerabilities usually comes from
      the open NIST database which is updated regularly since
      new weaknesses and vulnerabilities are reported all the time.  
      This also implies that the analysis should be repeated regularly, ideally
      daily and as part of an automated build process, using the latest version
      of the weakness and vulnerability database.  As new weaknesses, vulnerabilities,  
      and exploits are found, components may then have to be updated to mitigate any
      new weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Examples of tools:</strong>
      Just as with static code analyzer software, our major suggestion
      would be to choose a well-established, mature tool that is actively
      supported and developed. Some examples include Protecode [[Protecode]],
      Dependency-check [[OWASP-Dependency-Check]], and Snyk [[Snyk]].

    <section id="runtime-weakness-discovery">
      <h3>Runtime (Dynamic) Weakness Discovery</h3>
      <p>In contrast to static weakness discovery, runtime
      weakness discovery does not require access to the source code or
      compiled binaries of a component, but merely an ability to access a
      component's exposed interfaces (especially network-facing interfaces)
      and/or an ability to observe and modify the protocol and the 
      component's communication with other components.
      </p><p>
      The goal of runtime weakness discovery is to find an interface input 
      or protocol modification that leads to unintended behavior, such as component
      deadlock or crash.  Even if a crash is not the desired outcome for an attacker,
      a crash is also an indication of a weakness, such as a 
      lack of input validation, that can be used in more sophisticated exploits.
      Of course finding inputs that cause such problems and mitigating them
      also increases the overall robustness and quality of the code.
      </p><p>
      Just as with static weakness discovery, many tools exist to
      help with this task.  For web services, it is generally a bit harder to reach full
      automation (with the exception of fuzz testing) here, and the best results
      can usually only be achieved by combining both manual and automated tasks.
      However, the advent of API metadata such as OpenAPI and the WoT Thing Description
      may in the future lead to more sophisticated and automated tooling in this
      area.
      </p>

      <section id="fuzz-testing">
      <h4>Fuzz Testing</h4>
      <p>Fuzz testing is one of the most well known and used runtime weakness
      discovery methods. It is well-automated, many tools exist for common
      protocols and payloads.  
      It is a very powerful method for weakness discovery.
      Fuzz testing works by generating (randomly or pattern-based) highly
      varied input for a specific network exposed interface or protocol payload,
      sending this input to the tested component, and observing the result.
      If a "desired" outcome happens (such as tested component crashes), the
      corresponding input and details of the crash are recorded for the
      analyst to manually process.</p>

      <p>The biggest challenge with fuzz testing is usually to be able to
      generate the randomized input in a form that is still "correct enough"
      that it does not get discarded by the lower layers of software or network stack. 
      For example, if the fuzz testing goal is to test how a network-enabled thermostat 
      processes numeric values on its temperature setting HTTP-exposed interface,
      it is important that fuzzed requests have valid HTTP headers, body
      structure, etc. This way the requests will get delivered all the way
      to the high-level logic inside the device runtime 
      and will not discarded by lower-level HTTP message validation
      and processing components.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Examples of tools:</strong>
      There are numerous tools exists for fuzzing
      HTTP(S)-exposed interfaces. 
      Examples include Burp Suite [[Burp]], Wfuzz [[Wfuzz]], and Wapiti [[wapiti]].
      Newer protocols, like COAP(S) and MQTT(S), have considerably fewer tools
      available.  However some do exist.
      Examples for CoAP(S) include fuzzcoap [[FuzzCoAP]] and CoAP Peach Pit (from Peach Fuzzer)
      [[PeachPit-COAP]].  Some of these may still in the experimental phase.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="protocol-analysis">
      <h4>Protocol Analysis</h4>
      <p>In addition to automated Fuzz testing, one might be able to discover
      weaknesses by manually analyzing protocol elements such as
      headers, payload, and attributes. 
      For example, an analyst might look for the use of older encryption 
      or authentication algorithms, or the use of insecure combinations of protocol options.
      While the actual protocol analysis is a manual process, 
      many tools exist to capture the protocol traffic, parse it
      according to the protocol, and present it to the analyst in an organized fashion.

      <p><strong>Examples of tools:</strong> Examples of network protocol
      analyzers include Wireshark [[Wireshark]] and tcpdump [[tcpdump]]. </p>
      </section>

      <section id="vulnerability-scanners">
      <h4>Vulnerability Scanners</h4>
      <p>There are many tools available that attempt to perform runtime
      testing for known vulnerabilities. They usually operate
      by attempting to run a known set of exploits or weakness trigger inputs
      against the target and report the outcomes. 
      Such tools should be used in combination with other testing tools
      in order to obtain a more complete runtime weakness and vulnerability discovery result.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Examples of tools:</strong> While many different vulnerability
      scanners exist, some specifically target web applications and web server
      service vulnerabilities and are therefore more focused. 
      Examples include w3af [[w3af]],
      the Burp vulnerability scanner [[Burp]], Nikto [[Nikto]], and WATOBO [[WATOBO]].

      <section id="exploitation">
      <h3>Exploitation</h3>
        <p>When a weakness or a set of weaknesses is found for a component,
        it is important to estimate the exploitation risk level for them.
        Exploitation risk level aims to determine if a particular
        weakness can be converted into a vulnerability and
        used by an attacker to achieve particular attack end goals,
        such as privilege escalation, authorization bypass, denial of service, and so on.
        This step can help to prioritize the order in which weaknesses must be mitigated.
        Developers should fix the most easily exploitable vulnerabilities first and 
        then continuing with others in decreasing level of severity or probability of
        exploitation.
        Some tools mentioned in section <a href="#protocol-analysis"></a> can be used to test
        the exploitabilty of a particular weakness. Additionally, for known
        vulnerabilities, the Exploit-DB [[exploit-db]] database hosts many public exploits
        and allows to search by the CVE number of the associated (known) vulnerability.
        However, it is important to remember that it is generally very hard to reliably
        determine the exploitability of a given weakness: if an exploit cannot be
        found, it does not guarantee that the weakness is not exploitable. Moreover,
        for some weaknesses, they might not be exploitable on their own, or may
        only be weakly exploitable, but may still play
        an important role in the attacker exploitation chain as a stepping stone towards
        the end exploitation goal. 
        Therefore, it is strongly encouraged to fix or mitigate all 
        weaknesses discovered in analyzed components.</p>

    <h2>Security Testing Plan Framework</h2>
      <p>Given the above background, we can now outline a testing plan framework for WoT Systems.
      This is just an outline and would have to be expanded and adapted for the specific
      circumstances and application area of the WoT System under test.  In particular, some
      tool choices may depend on the programming language, build environment, network environment,
      and budget (for non-free tools).  Also the testing procedure will be different for
      purpose-built devices and services vs. pre-existing devices and services.</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong><a href="#static-weakness-discovery">Static Weakness Discovery</a></strong> 
        <ol>
        <li><strong><a href="#static-code-analysis">Static Code Analysis:</a></strong>
        If source code is available, a static code checker should be used to check
        for weaknesses in new purpose-written code.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="#known-vulnerability-checking">Known Vulnerability Checking:</a></strong>
        If binaries and/or a list of package dependencies are available, a vulnerability
        checker should be used to check for known weaknesses and vulnerabilities in any libraries used.

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong><a href="#runtime-weakness-discovery">Runtime Weakness Discovery</a></strong> 
        appropriate tools 
        such as <a href="#fuzz-testing">Fuzz Testing</a>,
        <a href="#protocol-analysis">Protocol Analysis</a>,
        and <a href="#vulnerability-scanners">Vulnerability Scanners</a>
        can be discover problems even when only the network interface is
        available, and are complementary to other kinds of checks.
     </li>
     <li><strong><a href="#exploitation">Exploitation Analysis</a></strong> 
        This can be used to prioritize which weaknesses and vulnerabilities should be addressed
        first or whether a given vulnerable system can even be used in a given
        environment. 
     </li>
     </ol> 
     <p>Ideally, security testing should be integrated into the development process
     and all discovered weaknesses addressed as soon as possible.  If this is
     not possible, weaknesses should be prioritized based on the threat
     model and potential for exploitation and addressed in priority order.
     </p>
    </section> 
            
    <section>
    <h2>Suggested Testing Frequency</h2>
        <p>The actual detailed test procedure depends on the type of activity, the WoT
        device setup and the actual test tool used. 
        However, below are our general recommendations
        for the frequency of different testing activities:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong><a href="#static-weakness-discovery">Static Weakness Discovery</a></strong> 
        should be done regularly,
        ideally integrated into the development work flow for a WoT component.
        This is important, since any even small code changes can introduce
        development mistakes, or alternatively new weaknesses can be 
        discovered in the libraries that a program depends on.  
        New weaknesses and vulnerabilities
        are discovered in existing libraries almost daily.
        </li>
        <li><strong><a href="#runtime-weakness-discovery">Runtime Weakness Discovery</a></strong> 
        should be also done on a regular basis, for example for each major release
        or development milestone.
        </li>
        <li><strong><a href="#exploitation">Exploitation Analysis</a></strong> 
        should be done occasionally,
        whenever possible.  
        It is the most time and resource consuming
        activity, often requires external resources with specialized knowledge,
        and cannot in general be automated.
        </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>A security testing plan focused on weakness and vulnerability discovery
      has been presented that leverages existing tools and approaches for web services
      and emerging tools for new IoT-oriented network interfaces.
      A testing plan should be developed suitable for each system developed using the
      WoT architecture but will generally consist of three stages:
      <a href="#static-weakness-discovery">static weakness discovery</a>,
      <a href="#runtime-weakness-discovery">runtime weakness discovery</a>,
      and <a href="#exploitation">Exploitation Analysis</a>.
      A vulnerability is a weakness with a known exploit and should have priority for
      mitigation, but all weaknesses may potentially lead to vulnerabilities and
      ideally all weaknesses would be mitigated or corrected.
      In general, a WoT Thing Description can be used to describe both secure and
      insecure systems, and in fact this is necessary to support existing devices,
      which may or may not themselves be intrinsically secure.
      However, WoT Thing Descriptions provide new opportunities for understanding and
      planning security testing and mitigations.

      <h1>Terminology</h1>

      <p>
        Please refer to the 
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-wot-architecture-20170914/#terminology">WoT Architecture</a> 
	document for terminology definitions of the following terms used in this document: WoT Consumer,
    WoT Thing, WoT Servient, WoT Protocol Binding, WoT Binding Templates, WoT Intermediary,
    WoT Thing Directory, WoT Thing Description, Exposed Thing, WoT Interface, WoT Runtime, WoT Scripting API.
      </p>
        <p>
        Additionally we define the following terms:
        <dl>
          <dt>WoT System:</dt><dd>
           A set of WoT-enabled devices and the communication links between them.
          </dd>
          <dt>WoT Device:</dt><dd>
          A physical device that enables WoT layer on top of its software stack.
          </dd>
      </dl>
      </p>
    <p>Within the <a href="#security-validation">Security Validation</a> section
     we are using the security vocabulary defined by the ITU-T [[ITUx1500]], [[ITUx1520]], [[ITUx1524]]
      for the following terms:
      <dl>
          <dt>Vulnerability:</dt><dd>
           Any weakness in software that could be exploited to violate a system or the information 
           it contains 
           [[ITUx1500]].
          </dd>
          <dt>Weakness:</dt><dd>
          A shortcoming or imperfection in the software code, design, architecture, or deployment that, 
          could, at some point become a vulnerability, 
          or contribute to the introduction of other vulnerabilities
          [[ITUx1500]].
          </dd>
      </dl>
      In short, a weakness is a <em>potential</em> vulnerability.
      A weakness only becomes an <em>actual</em> vulnerability once an exploit is known.
