# WoT Security and Privacy
Github repository of the W3C Web of Things Security and Privacy Task Force to manage cross-cutting security and privacy considerations.

* [Threat Model](wot-threat-model.md): Assets, agents, risks, threats, and use cases.
* [References](wot-security-references.md): List of both normative and informative source material.
* [WoT Security and Privacy Considerations](index.html): A unified set of informative recommendations for security and privacy in a Web of Things system (Work in progress).

If you wish to make a contribution,
please be aware that since the master is being linked from other WoT documents
we want to keep it as stable as possible and are staging commits through
the "working" branch.
Issues and pull requests should be made to that branch, not master.
Conversely, if you want to see the latest (unstable) version,
checkout the "working" branch.
Issues should be filed against the working branch and will be closed when
updates are released to the master branch.
